# PympMyBeat

RB3+ Beat Analyser with visualisation 

Small experiment with the Raspberry Pi, using a basic beat detection system based on the "energy" of a given sample. 
If a threshold has been reached, it will activate some LEDs connected through the GPIO of the boards. 
You also get a 2000's old school audio visualisation on screen (Bars) a la Windows Media Player.
